xSolon.Tracing - Source Project
===============================
This project provides basic tracing functionality based on the .net System.Diagnostics namespace.
You are welcome to modify the source code as needed.
Some of the code (ActivityScope & LogicalOperationScope) has been inspired form the great Essential.Diagnostics 
(http://essentialdiagnostics.codeplex.com/) project under the Microsoft Reciprocal License (Ms-RL).
